# hestia-website

I created this website as an information and support hub for those seeking reproductive care.  I worked in a team of 4 to build the site, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with interactive features such as parallax scrolling and accordion menus.

You can browse the site yourself [here](https://ellahap.github.io/hestia-website/).
