# hestia-website

I created this website as an information and support hub for those seeking reproductive care.  I worked in a team of 4 to build the site, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with interactive features such as parallax scrolling and accordion menus.

You can browse the site yourself [here](https://660d5446-333a-4dea-b9c1-80c8e7c457bf-00-ecn7qsny23v1.spock.replit.dev/index.html).
